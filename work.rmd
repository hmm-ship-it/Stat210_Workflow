Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
#2* 5
#x = 3*4
#x<- 3*5
# <- alt + - makes assignment operator
# Objects must be named starting with letter, can contain . _ and numbers
#x
this_is_a_really_long_name <- 2.5
this_is_a_really_long_name1 <- 4.4
this_is_a_really_long_name <- 3.5
#Ctrl + Alt + Enter seems to do something extra in linux because it gives bash: -: No such file or directory
seq(1,10)
(x <- "hello world")

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.
